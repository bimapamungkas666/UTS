"1,Lawang Sewu,Ethan Josiah Effendi,5.0,""Not spooky at all. In fact, it was quite the opposite. It's basically a historical trip back in time to the colonial era from a train enthusiast perspective. If you want to gain the most experience possible, please do hire a guide there. For only several tens of thousand rupiahs you'll get complete inside knowledge of the place. Careful for the restricted spaces though, they have cameras."""

It has hundreds of doors, almost a thousand, that's why people call it """"lawang sewu"""", which means thousand doors. This place is well maintained, despite of its old age.

"10,Kota Lama Semarang,Gede Bagus Bayu Pentium,5.0,""It is a rising popular place in Semarang for both locals and tourists. The concept is the renewal of old building complexes from the colonial period. It has a lot of old buildings with colonial architecture. And then it's mixed with a lot of cafes, restaurants, photo spots, and places to chill. Unfortunately we went there during the day, it was quite hot and a lot of cars were going around. Our friend said during the night it would have a lot of light and very pretty. Especially on Saturday night it will have a car free night, so you can roam the area easily. I can imagine the place will be very nice if well lit during the night. Will try again to visit next time during night time."""

"13,Kota Lama Semarang,Akma Ikasari,5.0,""5 stars for the place. 3 stars for the experience during the day cause the weather was criminally hot. Would be nicer at night I suppose.

"17,Kota Lama Semarang,Ann,4.0,""The place was quite clean and tidy, yet it was confusing—lack of street signs might be the cause.

"18,Kota Lama Semarang,Rinaldi Suhardiono,5.0,One of the best area of culture and culinary destination in Semarang City.

"19,Kota Lama Semarang,Ali Aulia Rahman,5.0,""A very well maintained old-town in Semarang! Unlike any other old-town like Kota Tua in Jakarta or Malioboro in Yogyakarta, Kota Lama in Semarang was way way way cleaner it seems like their governor taking care of its old town very serious.

They painted their house walls and streets with a colorful paint like a rainbow and some mural too. It's so instagramable. But i give an average rating because it's basically just an usual village with rainbow color. We can go around the village and nothing to do. Maybe if there any kind of traditional art market or something like that, that can add value to the village."""
